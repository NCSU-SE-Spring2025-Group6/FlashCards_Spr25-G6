### Repository Rubric


- The project repo **MUST** have a branch called `MAIN`. Groups will be assessed via their commit history (seen under "Insights") in `MAIN`. Projects where all group members are not actively making commits will lose marks, or the offending student may be expelled from the group.
- Groups need to maintain an active discussion in some online forum. GitHub issue reports will be fun. Optionally, students can request a Discord channel. Projects where all group members are not active in discussions will either lose marks, or the offending student may be expelled from the group.


Each team starts with full marks but **loses** 0.33 marks for missing items:
